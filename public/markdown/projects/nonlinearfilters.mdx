# Non-Linear Filters

{/* ![FirstOrderNonLinearFilter-MainImage](https://github.com/StoneyDSP/NonLinearFilters/blob/0d1e2eb78f942be89081301d01248a76dd01bcef/FirstOrderNonLinearFilter/Res/FirstOrderNonLinearFilter-MainImage.png) */}

+ Initial implementation of non-linear 1st- and 2nd- order filters are up and ready to go...
+ More coming soon!

...stay tuned for more!

I will try to take some breaks inbetween GUI work and other errands in order to provide some interesting write-ups on the core module at play here - and the many myriad use cases that module has ahead :) - but life is generally busy and I only do this in my spare time, so please stay tuned :)
