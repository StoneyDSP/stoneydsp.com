# AudioPlugin-SVF
Simple Multi-Mode State Variable Filter using TPT, built directly from the StoneyDSP AudioPlugin template repository and the juce State Variable TPT Filter module (with a few mods)...

{/* ![Build-01-06-2022](https://github.com/StoneyDSP/AudioPlugin-SVF/blob/234151b0e6595737b33ef5a8f1afb08eb9214194/Res/SVF-AutoGUI-1-0-1.png) */}

This plugin is left quite bare-bones as it is intended to show how to integrate the AudioPlugin template repository with the off-the-shelf juce modules and ways of working (as best I can).

One should be able to compare the AudioPlugin template project against this source code, and easily spot how we've instantiated a dsp module and interacted with it via the APVTS.

# Built-in features:
+ variable oversampling up to 16x
+ variable processing precision (floats or doubles)
+ dry/wet mix with optional latency compensation
+ master output gain for "wet" signal
+ local context bypass switch
+ master bypass switch
+ resizeable GUI
+ de-coupled processing and true-bypass of audio processors in a lock-free atomic structure

# Manual - v1.0.0b

+ Frequency - Sets the centre frequency of the equalizer filter.
+ Resonance - Increases the amount of "emphasis" of the corner frequency
+ Type* - Chooses the type of filter to use. See below for more.
+ Oversampling - Increasing the oversampling will improve performance at high frequencies - at the cost of more CPU!
+ Mix - Blend between the filter affect (100%) and the dry signal (0%).
+ Bypass - Toggles the entire plugin on or off.
